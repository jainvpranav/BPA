                <h1>What we do</h1>
                <p>
                    We help organizations to cultivate an agile mindset and enable sustainable organizational agility. Our approach is not tied to any specific Agile methodology, thus giving people the flexibility to blend agile flavors and practices in a way that makes sense for their reality.
                    <br><br>
                    In pursuit of our mission, we work with experts and pioneers certified by ICAgile. They continuously work with course providers to accredit new or existing courses against proven learning objectives. In turn, these courses can be offered to agile individuals and organizations for professional-level certifications.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to accreditation and professional-level certifications, BPA Labs offers a competency-based expert certification program, which is unique in the industry. The ICAgile Certified Expert (ICE) certifications are extremely prestigious and are only awarded to individuals who demonstrate competence in a given track via a rigorous review process in front of a panel of industry-recognized experts.

                        We offer the following certification courses partnering with coaching experts recognized by
                        International Consortium for Agile (ICAgile). It is a community-driven organization that
                        consists of pioneers, experts and trusted advisors.
